The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It was a bright cold day in April, 
and the clocks were striking thirteen. The sky above the port was the color of television, 
tuned to a dead channel. I had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, 
as generally happens in such cases, each time it was a different story. Call me Ishmael. 
Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little 
and see the watery part of the world.
