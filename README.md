This repository contains the codes of the AI lab challenges solved by me.  All the codes in this repository is my approach to solving the lab problems and this repository is used to backtrack in case for references. These are not the perfect solutions to the problems given and can be sometimes wrong or incomplete.

All the Codes for the given questions are either in Python progarmming language. In order to run them all you need to do is have a python compiler installed in your computer and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Just download the ZIP archive, unzip it and open it in a code editor and the codes should be working.

My aim for this repository is solely for my reference and for people to learn the approach for the skill of problem solving. Please do not copy paste or use this as your answers to your assignments as it defeats the purpose of making this repository accessible.
